  % Update abstract to reflect the content of the paper
  This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as a "layout design copilot" in various domains such as semiconductor, IC, and microfluidics. We evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in generating basic elements and combining them into complex designs. Our experiments focus on via connections, microfluidics channel design, and fiducial marker generation. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs in layout design, highlighting the importance of providing expert knowledge and context to improve their performance.
