  % Update abstract to reflect the content of the paper
  This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as a "layout design copilot" in various domains such as semiconductor, IC, and microfluidics. We evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in generating basic elements and combining them into complex designs. Our experiments focus on via connections, microfluidics channel design, and fiducial marker generation. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs in layout design, highlighting the importance of providing expert knowledge and context to improve their performance.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Via Connection Experiment}
\subsubsection{Background}
In semiconductor processes, vias are essential for creating electrical connections between different layers of a chip. Proper via placement and connection are crucial for ensuring the functionality and reliability of the integrated circuit. This experiment explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to generate layout designs for via connections based on natural language descriptions and color-coded sketches.
\subsubsection{Experimental Setup}
The sketch-to-design approach using LLMs involves providing a natural language description of the desired via connection layout along with a color-coded sketch. The input format consists of a text description specifying the layers, dimensions, positions, and connectivity requirements, as well as a corresponding sketch where each color represents a specific layer (e.g., yellow for via, blue for metal, red for pad). The target output is Python code that generates the GDSII layout based on the provided description and sketch.
\subsubsection{Iterative Testing and Results}
We conducted a series of tests to evaluate the LLM's performance in generating via connection layouts. Figure \ref{fig:via_experiment} presents the sketch input and the corresponding outputs generated by the LLM for each test case.
\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Sketch input and LLM-generated outputs for the via connection experiment. The sketch depicts a desired layout with two vias connected by a metal layer and circular pads on top. The outputs show the progression of the LLM's understanding and refinement of the layout based on iterative feedback and context provided by the user.}

\end{figure}
In Test 1, we provided an initial description without a sketch. The LLM generated code based on the description, but the output had several issues, such as incorrect layer placement and missing connectivity. Test 2 involved a modified description, which led to some improvements in the generated code but still had limitations in terms of via placement and metal coverage.
Test 3 incorporated a detailed description along with the sketch. We performed iterative refinements by providing feedback to the LLM based on its generated code. This process highlighted the importance of clear and specific instructions for achieving the desired layout.
Test 4 focused on reproducing the best output from the previous tests. We asked the LLM to provide a detailed prompt based on the best output, and then analyzed the effectiveness of the generated prompt in reproducing the desired layout.
Tests 5-7 progressively added context (e.g., 3D packaging, TSVs) and domain-specific requirements to the input description. The results demonstrated the impact of context and domain knowledge on the LLM's performance, as well as the limitations and potential improvements.
\subsubsection{Lessons Learned}
The via connection experiment revealed several key findings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clear, detailed, and context-rich input is essential for LLMs to generate accurate layout designs.
\item Iterative refinement and user feedback play a crucial role in guiding the LLM towards the desired output.
\item LLMs have limitations in understanding domain-specific requirements and constraints without explicit guidance.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Potential Improvements and Future Work}
To enhance the sketch-to-design approach for via connections, we propose incorporating domain-specific knowledge and design rules into the LLM prompts. This can be achieved by providing a comprehensive set of guidelines and constraints as part of the input description. Additionally, future experiments should focus on validating the effectiveness of the improved approach and exploring its applicability to more complex via connection scenarios.
