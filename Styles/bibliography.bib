  abstract      = "In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for
                   customizable 3D virtual spaces. Due to the significant human
                   effort required to create these virtual spaces, there is a
                   need for efficiency in virtual space creation. While existing
                   studies have proposed methods for automatically generating
                   layouts such as floor plans and furniture arrangements, these
                   methods only generate text indicating the layout structure
                   based on user instructions, without utilizing the information
                   obtained during the generation process. In this study, we
                   propose an agent-driven layout generation system using the
                   GPT-4V multimodal large language model and validate its
                   effectiveness. Specifically, the language model manipulates
                   agents to sequentially place objects in the virtual space,
                   thus generating layouts that reflect user instructions.
                   Experimental results confirm that our proposed method can
                   generate virtual spaces reflecting user instructions with a
                   high success rate. Additionally, we successfully identified
                   elements contributing to the improvement in behavior
                   generation performance through ablation study.",

  abstract      = "Standard cells are essential components of modern digital
                   circuit designs. With process technologies advancing toward
                   2nm, more routability issues have arisen due to the
                   decreasing number of routing tracks, increasing number and
                   complexity of design rules, and strict patterning rules. The
                   state-of-the-art standard cell design automation framework is
                   able to automatically design standard cell layouts in
                   advanced nodes, but it is still struggling to generate highly
                   competitive Performance-Power-Area (PPA) and routable cell
                   layouts for complex sequential cell designs. Consequently, a
                   novel and efficient methodology incorporating the expertise
                   of experienced human designers to incrementally optimize the
                   PPA of cell layouts is highly necessary and essential.
                   High-quality device clustering, with consideration of netlist
                   topology, diffusion sharing/break and routability in the
                   layouts, can reduce complexity and assist in finding highly
                   competitive PPA, and routable layouts faster. In this paper,
                   we leverage the natural language and reasoning ability of
                   Large Language Model (LLM) to generate high-quality cluster
                   constraints incrementally to optimize the cell layout PPA and
                   debug the routability with ReAct prompting. On a benchmark of
                   sequential standard cells in 2nm, we demonstrate that the
                   proposed method not only achieves up to 19.4\% smaller cell
                   area, but also generates 23.5\% more LVS/DRC clean cell
                   layouts than previous work. In summary, the proposed method
                   not only successfully reduces cell area by 4.65\% on average,
                   but also is able to fix routability in the cell layout
                   designs.",

  abstract = {The prevailing methods to make large language models more powerful and amenable have been based on continuous scaling up (that is, increasing their size, data volume and computational resources1) and bespoke shaping up (including post-filtering2,3, fine tuning or use of human feedback4,5). However, larger and more instructable large language models may have become less reliable. By studying the relationship between difficulty concordance, task avoidance and prompting stability of several language model families, here we show that easy instances for human participants are also easy for the models, but scaled-up, shaped-up models do not secure areas of low difficulty in which either the model does not err or human supervision can spot the errors. We also find that early models often avoid user questions but scaled-up, shaped-up models tend to give an apparently sensible yet wrong answer much more often, including errors on difficult questions that human supervisors frequently overlook. Moreover, we observe that stability to different natural phrasings of the same question is improved by scaling-up and shaping-up interventions, but pockets of variability persist across difficulty levels. These findings highlight the need for a fundamental shift in the design and development of general-purpose artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes areas for which a predictable distribution of errors is paramount.},
